Read, write, parse and dump your nvme block through adb!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
* Use this tool at your own risk. I am not responsible for bricked devices. Please backup NVME before modifying any value.
* Avoid modifying encrypted values ‚Äã‚Äã(FBLOCK, WVLOCK, FRPLOCK, etc). These values can be only rewritten with their SHA256 hash.
* When reporting an issue, make sure to hide sensitive information (such as S/N, MACs, etc).
* If the tool isn't able to find a valid nvme block, you'll need to provide it as the last argument.

## üìú Requirements
* Huawei phone.
* Root shell (terminal/adb).
* The binary itself.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Features
* Read NVME values => `./nvme -r VALUE_NAME`
* Write NVME values => `./nvme -w VALUE_NAME NEW_VALUE`
* Dump the NVME block (dd) => `./nvme -b dump_path`
* Restore NVME dump (dd) => `./nvme -e backup_path`
* Set FBLOCK status => `./nvme -f <1|0>` (_dangerous option, proceed with caution_).
* Read NVME header info => `./nvme -z`

## üíª Building the tool
* If you want to compile this tool, you will need the android NDK kit.
* Once you installed NDK and you set up the exports, run `make` to build the tool.
